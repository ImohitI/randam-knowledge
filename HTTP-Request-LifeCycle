Generic Understanding
What happens if you go to www.google.com

1.First the browser needs to translate www.google.com to an IP address if it does not already know it. If it know it then nothing happens.
If it does not know it , it contacts a DNS server to resolve the name.

2.Then the browser will open a TCP connection to the IP address of google and send a HTTP GET request over. In this example it will be
GET / HTTP/ 1.1
Host : www.google.com

3.The server software will get this HTTP request. It will generate a HTTP response and send that back through the TCP connection.

4.When the browser gets the response , it typically renders it on screen. The HTTP request is now done. A click on search will send a new request to the server.

GET , PUT, POST , DELETE and others are other http request methods. 
Cookies are commonly used to identify the same user across multiple HTTP requests, called sessions. Therefore these cookies are called session cookies.
